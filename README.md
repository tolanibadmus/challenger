# 🏆 Challenge Leaderboard API (Java / Spring Boot)

This project is a Java Spring Boot REST API designed to manage time-based challenges and compute a leaderboard for an existing game. It allows players to join challenges, start and end them and ranks the participants(challengers) based on completion duration.
The system is backend only and can be plugged into a frontend to provide challenge tracking and leaderboard functionality.
